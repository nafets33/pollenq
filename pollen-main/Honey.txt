""" Logic of Weights 
# create 3 weights on how much to place buy
# 3 weights on time of day (9-10:30, 10:30-Noon, Noon-2:30, 2:30-4)
# 1yr indicates Day_Allocation from Total Funds (2 funds, Long, Day)
    > weight decreases over time to opposite direction
# RSI (20-50 % weight for Trade_Funds)
    > RSI Profit Take Override?
# Mac (50-80 % weight for Trade_Funds)
    > if Both 5day and 1day point up vs down
    > if they contradict lean to 1 days and lower Trade_Funds
    > If VIX in between relative mean lower Trade_Funds
    > If % profit equal
    > If Momentum equal lower_short
    > Time since last Mac(LE,SE) together
    > MacLE if weigh neg ticks and sells (maybe in vol) to consider hold period before profit take?
    > 1day Indicator follwed by 5 day gives more weight to hold time frame consider more profit
    > when both 1 day and 5 day have contridiction in same time frames (5day up, 1day down and vice versa)
    > HOW TO ingore Triggers? Base of Volume? Number of Trades, or stick with 5day?
# Increase in Tick on Highest Market Cap (Goog, appl...) weight to increasee Trade_Funds
# When Market opens X % up or down creation caution on Ups and Downs
# How far away from VWAP at each time interval of day? The further away towards end of session gives more weight to return to it (10:30, Noon, 2:30)
